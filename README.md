## INTELLIGENCE
### GROUND OPPOSITION
1) The Russian 429th Motor-Rifle Division is based at MAYKOP and has units deployed along the border including the SOCHI area.
2) Enemy deployement include static outposts as well as mobile groups that may relocate as needed to set up makeshift defensive positions and / or reinforce static defenses.
3) The two outposts nearest to the border can house anywhere between a platoon to a company sized armor/mechanized forces.
4) With the primary combat vehicles used by the 429th Division we exepect mainly T-72s and BMP-3s as frontline defenses.
5) Nearby Forward Operating Bases of the 429th are located at **N43deg 41'/E040deg 16.5'** and **N43deg 45'/E039deg 35'**. Each could hold at least one armored and/or mechanized force of company size, ready to dispatch at short notice to reinforce the border area. We evaluate that one of those is on high alert today.

### AIR DEFENSES
1) SOCHI airbase is protected by an SA-6 located just North of the airbase
2) Mobile air defenses of the 429th Division include SA-8s, SA-13s and SHILKAs deployed to provide anti-air support for the division's units
3) Suspected SA-6 battery may be deployed IVO LAZAREVSKOE (N43deg 55'/ E039deg 20') protecting a nearby command center (Estimated as a backup commandpost of 429th HQ) 
4) SA-10 battalions are stationed to defend the Russian airbases of NOVOROSSIYSK, MYKOP-KHANSKAYA and MINERALNYE-VODY
