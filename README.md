# BRIEFING
**v1.0 / Last updated 22-May-2021**

## SITUATION

A high-resolution map can be found [here](https://cloud.132virtualwing.org/s/5oXzPFr5enRAxyg)

1) After the successful annexation of the Cremea peninsula, Russia has turn its eyes towards the countries to its Southern border. 
A NATO taskforce was deployed to the Caucasus to reinforce and hopefully deter the russians of hostilities.

2) However two days ago hostilities broke with a series of clashes between Russian and NATO aircraft, as wel as a ground offensive into Azerbaijan.

3) NATO intelligence warns that Russian armed forces are setting up an offensive into Abkhazia through the SOCHI district.

4) Due to tactical situation and expected difficulties in defending the Abkhazian western coastal area, NATO HQ has authorized a preemptive assault.

## MISSION OBJECTIVES:
1) Deny the enemy of the SOCHI airbase by seizing surrounding key tactical terrain features

2) Degrade enemy ground forces combat strength, command and control and overall troops balance

3) Hold the secured area against enemy counter attacks and shape conditions for further offensive operations in the area.

## METHOD
1) Execute a ground offensive to seize and secure objectives SUSHI, NOODLES and WASABI with end-state holding at least one armored platoon on a defensive position on each objective

2) Eliminate enemy units in the SOCHI area to facilitate safety of movement of allied reinforcements through the region

3) Depending on availability of assets, additional SCAR, AI, SEAD and DEAD missions are to be expected

## INTELLIGENCE
### GROUND OPPOSITION
1) The Russian 131st Motor-Rifle Division is based at MAYKOP and has units deployed along the border including the SOCHI area.

2) Enemy deployement include static outposts as well as mobile groups that may relocate as needed to set up makeshift defensive positions and / or reinforce static defenses.

3) The two outposts nearest to the border can house anywhere between a platoon to a company sized armor/mechanized forces.

4) With the primary combat vehicles used by the 131st Division we exepect mainly T-72s and BMP-3s as frontline defenses.

5) Nearby Forward Operating Bases of the 429th are located at **N43deg 41'/E040deg 16.5'** and **N43deg 45'/E039deg 35'**. Each could hold at least one armored and/or mechanized force of company size, ready to dispatch at short notice to reinforce the border area. We evaluate that one of those is on high alert today.

### AIR DEFENSES
1) SOCHI airbase is protected by an SA-6 located just North of the airbase

2) Mobile air defenses of the 131st Division include SA-8s, SA-13s and SHILKAs deployed to provide anti-air support for the division's units

3) Suspected SA-6 battery may be deployed IVO LAZAREVSKOE (N43deg 55'/ E039deg 20') protecting a nearby command center (Estimated as a backup commandpost of 131st HQ) 

4) SA-10 battalions are stationed to defend the Russian airbases of NOVOROSSIYSK, MYKOP-KHANSKAYA and MINERALNYE-VODY

### AIR THREATS
1) The 3rd Fighter Aviation Regiment is a regional air-superiority regiment of the Russian Air Force. The regiment operates Su-27s and is usually known to hold squadrons at QRA at MAYKOP-KHANSKAYA and KRYMSK, however in past week there's been indications of a redeployment of the regiment's unit in light of escalations to the EAST. It is therefore should be expected that additional the regiment would operate out of more Eastern bases.

2) Yesterday for the first time we've observed CAP flight on station over the coastline and an A-50 operating to the North

## WEATHER
TBD

## COMMUNICATIONS
Frequencies masterfile [Frequencies masterfile](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18EyWLNdQU_xj3YLKJEMxFYs6gfiKxoTn/view?usp=sharing) . The masterfile contains airframe-specific kneeboard-ready sheets with the relevant presets.

ADMIN NOTE: This masterfile was copied from the OPAR campaign masterfile. Since OPERATION SOCHI is a single-event I resorted to avoid preset editing for participating airframes due to the workload involved. Therefore ALL ATC RELATED PRESTES ARE INVALID AND SHOULD BE INDIVIDUALLY CONFIGURED BY THE PILOT (Since the OPAR airbases are not used here...)
With that said, all TACTICAL frequencies and presets are valid and in effect.

## SPINS
1) AVOID damage to civilian infrastructure (Roads cratering, bridges destruction, railways, powerlines etc).

2) AVOID use of cluster munitions less than 1000m from civilian population.

3) AVOID damage to the SOCHI airbase (Cratering of runways and/or taxiways, damage to fuel storage or control tower etc) - The airbase should remain usable to support allied reinforcements via air delivery. 

## AIRFIELD INFORMATION
1) 617th, 696th and 259th squadron assets are based at GUDAUTA airbase

2) All other 132nd assets are based at SENAKI-KOLKHI

3) FARP DALLAS: N43deg 25'/ E040deg 06.9'/ 290ft

## AIRSPACE CONTROL PLAN
1) COMBATFLITE file TBD
